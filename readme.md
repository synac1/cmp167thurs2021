# Java is an Object Oriented Programming language
# Four Pillars: Polymorphism, Inheritance, Encapsulation, Abstraction


# Polymorphism : Poly : Multiple,  Morphism: form
- overloading and overriding 
- Overloading Same name of methods but different parameter types
- Overriding : modifying a parent's method  in the child class

# Encapsulation: Restricting access to instance variables by having them private and  controlling the access to the instace variables by having setters and getters

# Abstraction: Hiding the logic behind class and providing interface for users to have access to functionalities of the classes

# Inheritance: Child inherits the attributes and behaviors from the parent
- Parent Class/Super Class / Base Class
- Child Class/ subclass

- extends 

	public class ChildClass extends ParentClass{
		
	}
